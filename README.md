# Whales_Machine_Learning

This repository contains the supporting material for publications about the analysis of Bryde's whale calls observed in the Panama basin in January and February 2015.

The individual whale calls that were detected and located by Tary et al., 2024, can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14998950.
